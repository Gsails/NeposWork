# Notes

- At some point you need to mention that Nepos wrote in Latin.
- You need to explain the battle at Aegospotamoi. Important stuff your readers need to know:
  - Lysander was a Spartan commander, and that this was during the so-called Peloponnesian War.
  - This was a 26-year long war between Athens and Sparta. It was a "world war" for the Greeks.
  - The battle at Aegospotamoi crippled Athens' naval power, and led to Sparta winning the war.
- I like your observation that Nepos emphasizes that the battle was "easy", while others (who?) say it was "prestigious". That is good stuff… mention how they are not mutually incompatible.
- You can remove the bit about "boastful" if it doesn't help.
- Bit about establishing governments in cities… is this after Athens lost the war?
- Remember that a paragraph should have one point.
- Bit about the letter… Tell this in relatively short, straightforward sentences. Don't leave out any parts! Remember you are telling a story.
- For the conclusion… the main point is that, of all the Eminent Commanders, Lysander has "eminence" without virtue; he is marked by being in the right place at the right time. At the end of his life, his effort to cheat and give himself a better reputation failed miserably.
