## Nepos

Cornelius Nepos was born in 110 BCE and died in 24 BCE. He was from a region in northern Italy called Cisalpine Gaul.[^Brittanica] The most famous piece of writing Nepos has to his name is *Lives of the Eminent Commanders,* in which he wrote biographies of the foreign commanders. Nepos focused his writing on educating the public and explaining how these leaders came to power and what they did with their power.

## The "Life of Lysander"

The meaning of Lysander is "liberator", a name comprising of the elements “lysis" (freedom/loosening) and "andros" (man). In Greek history, Lysander was a Spartan naval and military commander in 400 BCE. In 408 BCE he was made admiral of the Spartan fleet and he died in the 395 BCE.

While most commanders are known for their extreme intelligence or complicated military strategies, Lysander has a different story. He was more known for the wealth that he had received and the ease of receiving it. Nepos explains that the Athenians were not difficult to conquer in fact it was almost as if they wanted to be conquered. He was able to defeat the Athenians because they were said to be disobedient to the commands of their leaders, straggling about in the fields, and abandoning their vessels. Lysander was able to defeat the Athenians because he was in the right place at the right time.  Lysander became so boastful of this victory that the Lacedaeamonians under his rule incurred the greatest unpopularity in all of Greece during that time period.  When Lysander captured the enemies at Agespotamus he made it seems as if it were for the sake of the Lacedaemonians, but it is clear that it was to feed his greed and ambition, to rule as much as possible.

Lysander established a government [in Athens when he won the war?] in which he appointed ten men in each city who conferred supreme authority, and controlled all of the proceedings. These men were appointed with no relation to him.  So there was no bias when appointing these men, nepotism was not allowed. Nepos begins to list many of the faults and issues with Lysander. His government is now abolished and he is starting to lose authority and respect. Nepos conveys the miscreant personality of Lysander as he tries to corrupt the sanctuaries Delphi and Dodna. The priests of Jupiter disappointed him as he failed to persuade them for his venal purposes.


After Lysander died Nepos speaks of an a letter that seemed to have been written by the “gods”. It was actually written by Cleon of Halicarnassus. It essentially was Lysander’s last attempt to win the hearts of his people.  When Lysander began to realize that his cruel and vicious acts during the war were going to be told to the countrymen, he asked Pharnabazus [who is this guy?] to present a testimonial speech to the Ephors, the magistrates who exercised a supervisory power over the kings of Sparta. He wanted the letter to defend what he did and make it seem like he was not wrong for what he did and that he should be praised. But soon after he read it over and submitted it, Pharnabazus substituted the letter. The other letter explained that Lysander was greedy and deceitful and accused him for everything he wanted expunged. Thus, making Lysander his own accuser.



## Conclusion

Nepos has made it clear that the purpose of writing the piece on Lysander was to show that not all leaders were known for their good doings and positive work. Some were infamous and were able to gain their power through other areas. The idea of fabrication in that Lysander wanted a letter written to wipe out all of his wrong doings that he shamefully committed.
